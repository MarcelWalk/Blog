## Intro
I'm a passionate software developer located in Leoben, Austria.
I love to learn new programming languages and IT topics in general.
For example maintaining servers, building networks, CI/CD, Software Architecture, 
and everything else that comes to my mind :grin:

I started with software development during school and I'm entirely self-taught,
which turned out, wasn't the easiest way to get a job in software development :sweat_smile:

In my free time I tinker on my servers and attend coding contests, I'm a big fan of linux
and open-source software. I even code on personal projects, if I happen to get 
a idea I consider worth following

## Skills
C#, C, Python, Go, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Visual Studio, PyCharm, Shell, Docker, TypeScript, Ansible
